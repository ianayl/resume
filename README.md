# Resume

**Tl;dr** simple resume in `webdev`, general resume in `general`

A generalist resume is in the `general` folder. This is ordered by experiences, thesis, plus stuff most applicable to the current market first.

However, people I have shown my resume to has said that my generalist resume was way too technical and confusing -- I am told that the average HR personnel / recruiter would never understand my resume, as it requires significant technical background knowledge to fully comprehend what I was doing. As a result, I have made a new, simpler version of my resume in the `webdev` folder. This resume is organized with all web development related stuff first, so recruiters can see at a quick glance that I am not completely detached from reality, and is in-fact capable of doing simpler tasks `B^)`

However, I am also _very_ fascinated with programming language design and compilers, so I have a `compilers` folder for a compiler-oriented resume first. This one prioritizes compiler stuff first.
